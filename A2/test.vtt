WEBVTT


00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.849
 permission.


00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:01.320
 Cool.


00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:02.250
 Okay, sweet.


00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.500
 So s so to start it off.


00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:12.650
 Um, So when you when you started out in sales, How how will you How where you trained?


00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:21.469
 Um, at least Well, you train and you probably were entrance and sells, like, what is your history of your


00:00:21.469 --> 00:00:22.070
 career?


00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.370
 Because you came into **** sort of better.


00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:26.260
 And I presume, Yeah.


00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:31.300
 So, uh, get ah, a lot of sales methodology training.


00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.549
 So they'll run you through.


00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.149
 Uh, selling through curiosity have been through solution selling.


00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:38.979
 I've been through spin selling.


00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:45.119
 Whatever different companies care about, they want you to learn their methodology.


00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.070
 And then so every organization has their own methodology.


00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:49.380
 ****.


00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:57.719
 Yeah, or they have no methodology and just kind of a style of selling the project catcher there.


00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.170
 So how does that, like the managers go about teaching you them?


00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.620
 I thought methodology.


00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:08.769
 Like, what are the what are the channels or what are them?


00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:12.140
 How they introduced the training ****.


00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:20.739
 So it's usually an outside consultant comes in for okay, you know, three day all all day event, and then


00:01:20.739 --> 00:01:29.799
 you might have, like, one or two follow up sessions or practices with, you know, managers peers or or the


00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.099
 same consulting folks ****.


00:01:32.629 --> 00:01:34.950
 And this is throughout what period of time.


00:01:35.739 --> 00:01:43.890
 I mean, usually it's maybe over a month, but the three days air usually like after it's usually a three


00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.950
 day session **** Capel's and then go and execute.


00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:52.239
 So there's three day session of the training.


00:01:52.239 --> 00:02:00.280
 And then after that, issues, you know, go go on the field and kind of Yeah, the better, the better


00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.590
 one.


00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:07.879
 Uh, Borg's will have, you know, some some type of like they'll map it to their sales process a little


00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:08.219
 bit.


00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:15.250
 So Okay, What you learn kind of maps, too, What you're expected to do and working deals.


00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:26.139
 **** reinforcement is usually, like, you know, maybe maybe once, once 1/4 once every six months, they'll have, like, a


00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.460
 check in meeting to say so.


00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:30.300
 Once 1/4 you gotta take a meeting.


00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.780
 Yeah.


00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:31.659
 Are we ended?


00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:35.810
 And, uh, are we doing still doing that challenger stuff I was to go in, right?


00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.379
 You know what kind of issues you run into ****?


00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:39.650
 Maybe once 1/4.


00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:41.879
 So it's a celeb cells, right?


00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:43.189
 Being on boarded.


00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.490
 Do you?


00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:51.389
 Would you would you like for For that to me more often to see if you know you're being effective


00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:54.250
 in your in your in your approach.


00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.419
 Yeah.


00:02:55.419 --> 00:03:04.250
 I mean, I think, like, like is probably not the the correct concept, because you know what sells wraps?


00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.199
 Ah, you know, most times they tell you, just leave me alone.


00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:14.509
 If they're veterans will say, Just leave me alone and let me do my thing and figure it out.


00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:22.169
 And so, um, you know, I would say, uh, like, actual skills coaching.


00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:28.710
 Most raps will say, You know, just tell me what I gotta do, and I'll go figure it out.


00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:35.180
 Now, you know, if you can show me that little May actually make me more effective than you know, then


00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.360
 I'd be more interested in casual regular check ins.


00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:39.199
 Catic.


00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.979
 So, after you finish like that on boarding, how do you start your first year?


00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:47.580
 Like, for example, to like to help you on the understanding the topic in the field.


00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.139
 What types of training are there in your company?


00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:52.960
 Ah, kind of like what?


00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.400
 It's a face to phase what One of the channels conferences.


00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.099
 Messages for to do.


00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.750
 Which part?


00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:08.409
 So when after your arm boarding So So you understand the topic, Uh, off the company in the field.


00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:16.069
 What kind of what kind of channels The managers usually use it Say the most typical is gonna be peer


00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.879
 to peer.


00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.050
 Mentor ends the go shadow, one of the veteran wraps.


00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:27.480
 Learn from them, do what they do, and then manager is going to provide.


00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:36.050
 You know, some coaching are usually more specifically around specific deals and how you're working a specific opportunity.


00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:37.100
 I see.


00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.779
 And it's probably different through it.


00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:39.839
 Different in decisions.


00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:40.199
 Correct.


00:04:41.829 --> 00:04:47.000
 So which one have you found That is the more effective from your experience?


00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:49.699
 Um, yeah.


00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:57.670
 I mean, I think, uh, the peer to peer peas is where, you know, especially ah, veteran rap will come


00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:04.000
 in, figure out who's doing it well, and then checking in to say, how is this actually done?


00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.199
 Like, you know?


00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:10.060
 Okay, we know we know what the official training is, but tell me what it really takes.


00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.839
 The wind deals get him through.


00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:12.060
 ****.


00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.449
 Approved internally.


00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:23.250
 Uh, and so the you know, the thing I like about sales had probably the most is the idea of


00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:32.629
 of being able to skip that process and make it more efficient at scale with learning from peers without having


00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:33.139
 Thio.


00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.889
 Have everyone call me up and say, You know what?


00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:37.639
 How do you do this?


00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:38.350
 How do you do that?


00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.089
 How do you do?


00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:40.269
 Whatever.


00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:47.399
 So, Dad, probably the tool they use for that Most **** viewings correct What isn't tool that helps you most


00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:55.300
 to keep up with that deal wins, you know, pitch, pitch, practice and have others talk about it.


00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:56.529
 Demo practice.


00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.790
 You know, I want to see what I came in.


00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:03.269
 I remember Dave Lichtman was was the veteran wrapping.


00:06:03.269 --> 00:06:08.949
 So I watched a lot of Dave's videos on how he presented how he talked about the solution.


00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:17.680
 Ah, how you won deals and, you know, kind of, um, focusing in on what one of the top people


00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.550
 doing at the at the pieces in the sale cycle that I know are important.


00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:30.250
 So how is a communication guided when whenever you communicate to a manager, what are the topics that you talk


00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:30.649
 about?


00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:39.550
 I mean, I would say, uh, you know, since my first couple years, it's mostly about deals.


00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.850
 Carrie, are you working deals?


00:06:43.079 --> 00:06:44.220
 Where are we with deals?


00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:44.589
 Piper.


00:06:44.589 --> 00:06:46.709
 How's your pipeline out.


00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:51.379
 How's your Ah, you know, how is your forecast pipe?


00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:55.639
 Pipeline forecasts and, uh, **** attainment.


00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:57.050
 Where are we for the year?


00:06:57.639 --> 00:06:59.620
 So how often do you communicate?


00:06:59.779 --> 00:07:10.250
 Is it weekly is a daily monthly, Um, so add ad hoc, you know, probably weekly.


00:07:10.839 --> 00:07:20.050
 And then, you know, former formally, um, you know, as in a group setting weekly.


00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:25.910
 Okay, so they also have group group meetings with all the sales reps.


00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:33.769
 So between the one on one and the group meetings, um, what is what?


00:07:33.779 --> 00:07:35.649
 Things need more effective way.


00:07:37.439 --> 00:07:46.350
 Um, I think group meetings are more effective for knowledge transfer.


00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:55.480
 Where you got something that's universal, right then one on one is was much better for kind of deal status


00:07:55.480 --> 00:08:00.079
 and so that you're not sitting for two hours listening to every where everybody else is in their pipeline.


00:08:00.079 --> 00:08:06.329
 And, you know, I want to know where people are, but I don't really care about the details of what


00:08:06.329 --> 00:08:07.350
 they're working on.


00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.970
 I want to know what's you know.


00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:09.879
 What are the updates?


00:08:09.879 --> 00:08:10.790
 What do I need to know?


00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:16.839
 How do I do my job better but more of the universal things and then you know if we if


00:08:16.839 --> 00:08:19.810
 we want to go through individual stuff, do it individually.


00:08:20.639 --> 00:08:24.189
 So, yeah, the group settings, it's more like knowledge sharing.


00:08:24.279 --> 00:08:25.240
 Anything else?


00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.240
 It's like what works?


00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.250
 What Didn't work?


00:08:27.689 --> 00:08:28.259
 What can we do?


00:08:28.259 --> 00:08:30.250
 Better stuff like that?


00:08:30.639 --> 00:08:31.029
 Yeah.


00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.169
 What were the key?


00:08:32.169 --> 00:08:36.750
 Updates from from or get are gonna affect my ability to do my job.


00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:37.750
 That's him.


00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:43.970
 So when it comes to, ah, tools they used to track your deal progress.


00:08:44.659 --> 00:08:46.610
 Where do you store it And materials?


00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:48.950
 What do you use on to track?


00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:50.299
 Yes.


00:08:50.299 --> 00:08:54.940
 I mean, Salesforce's where I'm tracking the status of the deals.


00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:09.519
 And then, um, depending on what, um, what artifacts I'm using, They'll probably be in a Google drive, uh, and


00:09:09.519 --> 00:09:19.740
 then uploaded into sales force for Okay, So in bad management, off the progress and start in story.


00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:25.450
 And those artifacts is there any pain points that not right now that you're that you're experiencing that you wish


00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:27.850
 would be better in in terms of your work form?


00:09:28.639 --> 00:09:28.799
 Yeah.


00:09:28.799 --> 00:09:37.919
 I mean the main This is kind of specific to our our platform **** I'll being being able to use


00:09:38.909 --> 00:09:40.250
 presentations.


00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:47.919
 We're having a way to send content to prospects and, um and know when they're opening it.


00:09:47.929 --> 00:09:49.950
 How do you know how they're engaging with it?


00:09:50.879 --> 00:09:55.320
 She is my biggest workflow challenge like that, Scott.


00:09:56.539 --> 00:10:02.860
 So knowing when the wonder viewing something that you send him in, uh, **** being able to track that you


00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:12.399
 were there are Okay, Okay, Like I'm doing creating the documents, storing them, you know, knowing what I'm working on


00:10:12.549 --> 00:10:18.149
 I can do all that between, you know, cells for sales, a little drive.


00:10:18.149 --> 00:10:19.899
 And, you know, I've gotta flow there.


00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:20.750
 ****.


00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:25.690
 It's insurance of reporting your meeting customers to managers.


00:10:26.289 --> 00:10:28.580
 How often did you do you do that at all?


00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:29.539
 Or does it?


00:10:29.549 --> 00:10:30.759
 It's a quick update.


00:10:30.759 --> 00:10:32.149
 Verbal update is enough.


00:10:32.639 --> 00:10:39.690
 Uh, everything's logged in sales for so every every, you know, with serious insights.


00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:46.049
 Every email is auto logged, as as an activity in sales force.


00:10:46.639 --> 00:10:54.039
 And then, um, I'll drop in, you know, meeting updates or whatever using Salesforce's.


00:10:54.039 --> 00:10:57.549
 My enough people want to know what's going on account to get the cells work.


00:10:59.139 --> 00:10:59.590
 Gotcha.


00:11:00.539 --> 00:11:01.149
 Okay.


00:11:01.539 --> 00:11:06.620
 Um, so not only in cell suit, but in the past.


00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:16.200
 How does your manager Valerie, your performance revenue is ah, is nine minutes of it.


00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:17.879
 You know, there, there.


00:11:17.879 --> 00:11:23.090
 May they They may talk about some other things, like, are you?

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:44.519
 So do you think cells the cells training that you are like dis **** training that you've have so far


00:11:44.799 --> 00:11:54.120
 What parts of it needs to be, uh, improved to be more effective from your opinion **** like, **** ****


00:11:54.120 --> 00:12:00.169
 experience that you have so far admitting you up to a deal with, For example, as you get on board


00:12:00.169 --> 00:12:04.039
 it, Um, yeah, the night.


00:12:04.039 --> 00:12:07.179
 So the feedback I gave when I first came in.


00:12:07.179 --> 00:12:12.450
 And, you know, uh, this is, you know, almost almost three years ago now, right?


00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:13.389
 Yeah.


00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:23.580
 Uh, you know, I always appreciated the they they easily digestible nous of getting the getting on boarding, um, through


00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:25.960
 sales that I did a lot of it on the tray.


00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:30.570
 I used to do the train ride up to the city, And so I want you on my way up


00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:33.580
 I'd listen to their Ryan on my walk to the office.


00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:35.879
 You know, I have 40 minutes to be that.


00:12:35.879 --> 00:12:38.350
 So that that that was all pretty dynamic.


00:12:38.409 --> 00:12:46.929
 Um, I'd say, you know, oh, are in our early phase, it was just way too much content, like it


00:12:46.929 --> 00:12:50.409
 was It was unpriced **** it ized.


00:12:50.419 --> 00:12:57.210
 And, you know, a lot of a lot of noise so that, you know, it was hard to tell what


00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:01.350
 is actually gonna make me sell better.


00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:07.080
 Um, so you know, my initial feedback waas kind of less is less is more.


00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:13.649
 Give me Give me the basics and the need to nose and then let me get some experience and then


00:13:14.039 --> 00:13:14.970
 phase it out.


00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:22.200
 Uh, so that I, you know, I can do the 101 Get some experience to the to Out to get


00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:24.549
 somebody to write with.


00:13:25.039 --> 00:13:26.340
 That's a big one.


00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:34.230
 Um, you know, I was fortunate to do about selling through curiosity live early on at my time here.


00:13:34.259 --> 00:13:43.679
 And so I found that, you know, as all these courses, but I thought that was that was effective challenges


00:13:43.679 --> 00:13:49.980
 we had where we just didn't have enough scale as a team to make it a regular kind of reinforcement


00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:54.480
 things, though, uh, you know, um, or more teammates.


00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:58.570
 Reinforcement, uh, is always is always good with that kind of stuff.


00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:06.419
 Just like, you know, when Ron came in, he reignited the r b e e er discussion, which is, you


00:14:06.419 --> 00:14:09.389
 know, how you build relationships with customers.


00:14:09.389 --> 00:14:15.299
 And I really like that he I feel like he has a real incentive to promote culture and the cells


00:14:15.299 --> 00:14:17.029
 organization, which is really cool.


00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:26.000
 Yeah, so But the only way only way that stuff like that happens is if you've got a measurable trackable


00:14:26.299 --> 00:14:28.549
 progress, you're sharing best practices.


00:14:29.549 --> 00:14:39.350
 So that's, you know, even even with our platform reinforcement and, you know, kind of just regular regular cadence vs


00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:41.779
, um, be ****.


00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:44.450
 Training is is always is always better.


00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:49.120
 Yes, And now we're talking about sharing experiences and knowledge.


00:14:49.860 --> 00:15:01.360
 So, Woody, which you do personally prefer, Do you prefer peer sharing Is a discussions conduct trainings or consultation sessions


00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:07.149
 How do you best think that for you kind of works best for sharing knowledge?


00:15:08.639 --> 00:15:08.919
 Yeah.


00:15:08.919 --> 00:15:16.129
 I mean, I, uh I would say, you know, give me, give me the basics and then, you know, if


00:15:16.129 --> 00:15:17.740
 it's something Maurin depth.


00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:21.299
 Let's get together and talk about it for a session.


00:15:21.299 --> 00:15:23.230
 So you know it.


00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:31.070
 I don't need to be lectured at for, you know, a period you know are or just get something to


00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:31.419
 read.


00:15:31.429 --> 00:15:35.690
 Let me give me whatever it is that's gonna help me understand the concepts.


00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:41.220
 And then let's get on the phone for the least amount of time necessary to make sure we got it


00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:48.139
 right and, you know, know howto apply it and then get on with my life s So it's more like


00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:50.169
 give me the concentrated stuff.


00:15:50.179 --> 00:15:54.929
 You mean you mean don't give me all this content that you know I'll spend like hours kind of like


00:15:54.929 --> 00:15:55.720
 consuming.


00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:56.720
 It will kind of help me.


00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:02.049
 What kind of won't **** It's bullets, in fact, and that's working the pass and just like, let me get


00:16:02.049 --> 00:16:02.840
 on with my work.


00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:09.879
 Yeah, I mean, for sales reps to every every minute away from, you know, executing selling is money out of


00:16:09.879 --> 00:16:10.519
 my pocket.


00:16:10.529 --> 00:16:14.460
 Unless it's making every minute more effective, right?


00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:21.990
 So a soon as you hit that curve of I've gone from getting more value out of this to unwavering


00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:22.590
 time.


00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:25.049
 Then you take your money out of my pocket.


00:16:25.539 --> 00:16:27.210
 Yeah, Yeah.


00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:28.049
 Makes sense.


00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:32.110
 Eso finally, um my last question.


00:16:32.779 --> 00:16:37.549
 So which part of the cells that platform to you would you ideally want to add?


00:16:38.039 --> 00:16:44.009
 Something that is missing something that for years is that I wish I had this Maybe from the tool swept


00:16:44.009 --> 00:16:46.289
 sides that you're using that is out of cells.


00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:49.659
 Ah, yeah, for me.


00:16:49.669 --> 00:16:56.889
 Um, you know, I think it's still it's still the, uh it's the content sharing pieces.


00:16:56.889 --> 00:17:04.950
 That is the is the biggest one content sharing your being able to engage with with customers and not making


00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:05.049
 it.


00:17:05.049 --> 00:17:08.829
 Not just about learning and practicing ****.


00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:15.529
 Actually, you know, taking all that great stuff and being able to push it out to out to customers in


00:17:15.529 --> 00:17:22.160
 A in a way that they're they're engaging with with me in the sales process, and I can see kind


00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.849
 of where they are and when when they're engaged.


00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:28.170
 Yeah, that's one of the things that we're trying to push.


00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:29.650
 It's like most of it.


00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:32.759
 And most of the features have been focused on more and learning.


00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:33.430
 Yeah.


00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:39.529
 Now we want to focus more on the coaching and the selling so we wanna kind of push.


00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:46.750
 Kind of like the future sprints into more theme based where we tackle, you know, the major pain points for


00:17:46.759 --> 00:17:48.049
 for those personal ****.


00:17:48.539 --> 00:17:48.750
 Yeah.


00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:55.539
 I mean, for me as a seller, the more that you can bring me in to, uh, my daily and


00:17:55.549 --> 00:18:00.049
 engaging in my daily work flow the more I'm gonna take advantage of all the other stuff too.


00:18:00.539 --> 00:18:00.970
 Right?


00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:01.779
 Right, right, right.


00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:03.349
 Yeah, that makes sense.


00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:04.829
 All right, cool.


00:18:04.839 --> 00:18:07.519
 So those are the questions that I have for you?


00:18:07.529 --> 00:18:10.049
 Thank you very much for answering them.


00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:13.299
 I will be working these two weeks to get something.


00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:16.210
 He's Ah, I'm trying Thio.


00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:18.640
 Build some tools that will help more.


00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:24.950
 The kind of like the on boarding and the the the coaching off new sales reps in the Oregon.


00:18:25.339 --> 00:18:28.079
 So, um, you're you're inside.


00:18:28.079 --> 00:18:30.380
 It's really valuable giving that you're a veteran.


00:18:30.519 --> 00:18:34.549
 You have a lot of experience, a different the very organization.


00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:35.670
 So thank you for that.


00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:37.880
 Um so siphoned this.


00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:39.809
 Do you have any questions from the release?


00:18:39.809 --> 00:18:45.809
 Is that I that I have put out any feet back anything that I can answer for you?


00:18:45.809 --> 00:18:52.049
 In the meantime, No, I love the love, the dynamic search additions.


00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:54.539
 Yeah, I like that.


00:18:54.549 --> 00:19:02.119
 You know, I've just been in so many demos, had so many conversations, and you know that we've got we're


00:19:02.119 --> 00:19:04.809
 so close on the content side.


00:19:04.809 --> 00:19:11.170
 But, you know, some of the other competitors are, you know, much, much slicker and more.


00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:13.980
 Um What what's the right word?


00:19:14.289 --> 00:19:19.329
 Intuitive on how to get the content **** and more, more.


00:19:19.329 --> 00:19:23.779
 We can make it so that I could just figure out, like, all right, I need this kind of thing


00:19:23.779 --> 00:19:29.440
 Let me get down quickly to what I want and not have to go eight clicks into a folder and


00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:32.779
 then jump out of that folder and goto **** ****.


00:19:32.809 --> 00:19:33.950
 That's what I've found.


00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:36.259
 What I started when I started playing with it.


00:19:36.259 --> 00:19:42.460
 I found that, you know, just like looking at the decide decide many others is that while this is so


00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:44.420
 much use, reacted just like dropped down.


00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:50.490
 And I don't have to the amount of clicks that takes to reach the content so much left now and


00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:56.170
 then, if you filter, Do you know just you know, I think for me the kind of where we g


00:19:56.170 --> 00:20:02.150
 o The more we can add in kind of the rules and the customization so that I get a more


00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:03.539
 personalized experience.


00:20:03.539 --> 00:20:09.250
 I can say, you know, only show me the stuff that's relevant for me or be guided based on my


00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:11.799
 rail and what I've done before in my experience.


00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:15.549
 But that's that's the stuff that makes them or engaging in more personal.


00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:16.609
 Right, Right?


00:20:16.609 --> 00:20:16.880
 Right.


00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:17.299
 Yeah.


00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:17.950
 Awesome.


00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:19.109
 Oh, great.


00:20:19.119 --> 00:20:20.319
 Thank you for the feedback.


00:20:20.329 --> 00:20:23.430
 And we'll be working to improve that even more.


00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:24.759
 So you answered.


00:20:24.759 --> 00:20:25.849
 I ask you a question.


00:20:25.849 --> 00:20:28.480
 You answer me to remember what that question waas.


00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:31.660
 So it was about the next pitch.


00:20:32.569 --> 00:20:32.950
 Yeah.


00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:35.200
 It s so help me understand that.


00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:38.450
 So it's a random generator of.


00:20:38.839 --> 00:20:39.849
 And who is it?


00:20:39.859 --> 00:20:46.369
 It's designed for either a manager or appear to give Nephew took a feedback.


00:20:46.369 --> 00:20:51.630
 Yeah, so, like, it will once you finish the pitch, it will.


00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:58.470
 It will prompt that that motel, and we'll give you all the people that within that module that you haven't


00:20:58.470 --> 00:20:58.869
 reviewed.


00:20:58.869 --> 00:21:05.710
 So it's easy access where it's like, Okay, let me keep reviewing people and it kind of like it adds


00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:12.390
 to that that a loop of just say, Ah, not only learning by providing feedback that it's more that it's


00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:17.490
 effective for the person that you're reviewing and for the person that's learning So it keeps.


00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:19.809
 They're kind of like the ball rolling people.


00:21:20.339 --> 00:21:28.549
 Yeah, so I think just my my other ask around platform is just the thing you know constantly Think about


00:21:28.619 --> 00:21:32.079
 Okay, Now, what would a larger how would this experience be different?


00:21:32.079 --> 00:21:39.970
 But in a smaller and a larger customer, things like stories you know, are much less effective the way they


00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:41.980
 are today for a larger company.


00:21:43.759 --> 00:21:48.700
 If I've got 2000 reps and they're all recording, like where to stuff go?


00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:51.500
 How do I see the people that are in my region?


00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:52.220
 My team?


00:21:52.220 --> 00:22:02.779
 My, you know, like more **** more thought on the workflow for larger, you know, multi multi leveled teams.


00:22:03.099 --> 00:22:10.549
 I I can see more of what I want and make make all those organic capture features, you know, more


00:22:10.549 --> 00:22:14.349
 thoughtful about where content goes and who who sees it.


00:22:15.339 --> 00:22:16.930
 Yeah, yeah, that's really important.


00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:22.859
 Yeah, we're we're in the new process that we're trying to implement where it's, you know, it's ah, it's a


00:22:22.859 --> 00:22:30.380
 six week long process where we we capture a theme and you know, it's ah, it's an iterated of process


00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:39.140
 that defines it user flow and validating those ideas and with the real customers as yourself and like it into


00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:40.140
 real users.


00:22:40.349 --> 00:22:47.190
 And, um too, so we can better, um, improved the experience of up those those features.


00:22:47.309 --> 00:22:47.849
 Pressure?


00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:50.410
 Yeah, **** Cool.


00:22:50.559 --> 00:22:52.210
 Well, let me know if you have more questions.


00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:55.329
 I'll shoot you ever the link to the recording.


00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:57.759
 And, uh, yeah, let's make this ingrate.


00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.940
 All right, So you thank you, John.


00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:01.029
 Thank you for your time.


00:23:01.329 --> 00:23:01.720
 Thank you.
